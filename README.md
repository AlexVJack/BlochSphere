### Intro

This was inspired by quantum physics and a measurement process of spin. Every single time you measure the spin, it aligns to the axis you measure it by, eliminating its previous state.

Similar here â€“ as soon as you visit the page, it generates for you a "particle" or a "spherical galaxy" in such a way that once you refresh the page, the previous construction is permanently destroyed and replaced with a fresh one.
